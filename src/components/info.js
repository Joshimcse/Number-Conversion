      <h3>Hexadecimal System</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Hex</strong>, or hexadecimal, is a number system of base 16.
        This number system is especially interesting because in our casually
        used decimal system we have only 10 digits to represent numbers. As hex
        system has 16 digits, the extra needed 6 digits are represented by the
        first 6 letters of English alphabet. Hence, hex digits are
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 A, B, C, D, E, F. This number system is the most
        commonly used in mathematics and information technologies. I.e. in html
        programming colors can be represented by a 6-digit hexadecimal number:
        FFFFFF represents white, 000000 represents black, and so on.
